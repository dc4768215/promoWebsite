          <p>Bobby James Berk (born August 25, 1981) is an American interior designer, reality television personality and author. He stars in the Netflix series Queer Eye as the interior design expert.</p>
          <p>Berk was born in Houston, Texas to a young mother and then adopted by his maternal aunt and her husband, Connie and Jerry Berk. He currently has a good relationship with all three. He grew up in Mount Vernon, Missouri in the middle of Amish farm country. Berk cites that being gay in the Bible Belt and attending an Assemblies of God church throughout his childhood was difficult, and that he faced both internal and external homophobia growing up.</p>
          <p>Berk left home at the age of fifteen. He landed in Springfield, Missouri and got a job at Applebee's, in Branson, sleeping in his car or staying with friends. He drove home for school as a sophomore and briefly enrolled himself at Kickapoo High School for junior year. He ended up working as a telemarketer for MCI Communications. It was through this job that he first met his biological father. Just before he turned eighteen, he moved to Denver, Colorado, where he got a gig at the Bombay Company.</p>

          <p>Berk relocated to New York City in 2003 with just $100 in his pocket. He found employment at Restoration Hardware and Bed, Bath and Beyond before moving on to Portico, a high-end home furnishing company. With no high school diploma or formal training he worked his way up to creative director.</p>
          <p>After Portico folded in 2006, Berk launched his online store, Bobby Berk Home, in 2006, opening his first store in SoHo, Manhattan a year later. Midtown Miami, Florida followed in 2010 as well as Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. He later launched Bobby Berk Interiors + Design, specializing in interior design services, whose headquarters is in Downtown Los Angeles. He has appeared on television networks such as HGTV, NBC, CBS, and Bravo.</p>
          <p>He has been the design expert on the Netflix series Queer Eye since 2018. Berk appeared in Taylor Swift's "You Need to Calm Down" music video.</p>
          <p>Berk currently has his own line of wallpaper, furniture, and art. He also runs a full service interior design business.</p>
          <p>In 2021, Berk competed in season six of The Masked Singer as the wild card contestant "Caterpillar". He was eliminated alongside Willie Robertson as "Mallard" in Group B semifinal's episode.</p>

          <p class="title">WHY?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphs">
          <p>You must be wondering: Why is Bobby Berk the best member of Queer Eye? Well he's the best member because he does one of the more difficult tasks of making over the hero's homes. It's also what hero's are left with from the Queer Eye. </p>
          <p>So while Johnathan's haircut grows out, Tan's clothes start to feel tighter, Antoni's food gets spoiled, and Karamo's advice begins to fade, your home that Bobby created remains.</p>
